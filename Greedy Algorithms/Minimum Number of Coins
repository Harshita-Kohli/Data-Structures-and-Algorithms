//GREEDY: We use the largest denomination that is <= target
//TC: O(target), but actually it will be much less than the target, coz we are reducing the target each time drastically
//SC: O(no of denominations ie 10)
WHY GREEDY WORKS HERE? 
COZ In Indian Denomination, {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 2000 } 
Sum of no 2 consecutive coins exceeds the next coin ...(1+2 <5) ....(10+20<50)
But if coins were not in this denomination ,then greedy would have failed.
