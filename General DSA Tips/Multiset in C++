Multisets are a type of associative containers similar to the set, with the exception that multiple elements can have the same values. Some Basic Functions associated with multiset: 

a.erase() – Remove all instances of element from multiset having the same value
a.erase(a.find()) – Remove only one instance of element from multiset having same value

Time Complexity:
Insertion of Elements- O(log N)
Accessing Elements – O(log N)
Deleting Elements- O(log N)
