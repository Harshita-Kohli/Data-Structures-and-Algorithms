x & (x-1) will clear the lowest set bit of x
x & ~(x-1) extracts the lowest set bit of x (all others are clear). Pretty patterns when applied to a linear sequence.
x & (x + (1 << n)) = x, with the run of set bits (possibly length 0) starting at bit n cleared.
x & ~(x + (1 << n)) = the run of set bits (possibly length 0) in x, starting at bit n.
x | (x + 1) = x with the lowest cleared bit set.
x | ~(x + 1) = extracts the lowest cleared bit of x (all others are set).
x | (x - (1 << n)) = x, with the run of cleared bits (possibly length 0) starting at bit n set.
x | ~(x - (1 << n)) = the lowest run of cleared bits (possibly length 0) in x, starting at bit n are the only clear bits.

To toggle kth bit of a binary number:   
x^(1<<(k-1))
1) Left shift given number 1 by k-1 to create 
   a number that has only set bit as k-th bit.
    temp = 1 << (k-1)
2) Return bitwise XOR of temp and n.  Since temp
   has only k-th bit set, doing XOR would toggle 
   only this bit.
