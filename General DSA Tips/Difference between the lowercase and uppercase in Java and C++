JAVA: The String class provides an object String and some methods like: toLowerCase() and toUpperCase()
- String is an object that represents a sequence of characters. The java.lang.String class is used to create a string object.
- The toLowerCase() method converts a string to lower case letters.
- The toLowerCase() method converts a string to lower case letters.

CPP: Strings are objects that represent sequences of characters.
- char is primitive, string is not a primitive.
- tolower() and toupper() are not for converting the entire string to lower or upper case, but to convert the individual characters of the string
- tolower() and toupper() take character as parameter and switch the character's case.
- One would think that the standard string class has a member function that converts the whole thing to upper- or lowercase, but, in fact, it doesnâ€™t. If you want to convert a string of characters to upper- or lowercase, you have to do it yourself, sort of.
