//Recursive Approach:
//TC: O(logN base 2) coz we are dividing the number by 2 everytime
//SC:

//-----------------------------------
//Better Approach: Power of two wale numbers ki binary representation me sirf ek hi set bit hoti hai. Seedha count karlo no of set bits. Agar set bits 1 hi hai, to power of 2 hai
if(n<=0) return false;
if(n & (n-1)==0){//this clears the rightmost set bit, if on clearing that bit once, we get number = 0, it means this number had a single set bit, so it is a power of 2
    return true;//coz a number that is power of two has just one set bit, which gets cleared by taking AND with n-1
